航母航空保障系统作为“舰-机”协同纽带，直接影响舰载机作战能力。现行以人为主的作业方式在舰载机高峰出动模式下，存在人员易疲劳、不确定性等问题，制约了舰载机出动架次率。为了逾越作业人员生理瓶颈，促进保障系统向着智能化以及人机物深度融合的方向前进，本项目聚焦舰载“无人装备”的人机共融运动规划技术，主要研究动态开放场景中基于视觉感知的端到端任务分配与路径生成方法，建立人机共融的任务规划模型；探索自适应学习奖励函数的多智能体策略学习算法，结合人机共融的训练手段，打造青出于蓝的轻量化行为规划模型；研究智能辅助决策算法，弥合人机切换衔接间隙，构建人机共融的应急规划模型。本项目科学问题源于我国大型舰船作业保障技术体系智能化发展需求，旨在突破协同路径的秒级生成、关键动作的定位引导、人机共融的应急决策等关键技术瓶颈，实现稳健高效的人机共融运动规划系统，为我国航母航空保障系统的智能化发展提供有益的探索。

### Research on Motion Planning of Carrier-Borne Unmanned Equipment for Human-Machine Integration

As the mutual link of “carrier-aircraft”, the carrier aviation support system directly affects the combat capability of carrier-borne aircrafts. The current human-based support system has problems such as easy fatigue and uncertainty of operators when the system is running at high-load, which restricts the dispatch rate of carrier-borne aircraft. In order to overcome the physiological bottleneck of operators and orient the carrier aviation support system to intelligence and deep integration of “Human-cyber-physical”, this project focuses on the human-machine integrated motion planning technology of carrier-borne unmanned equipment. Main research topics include but not limit to: 1) Research on the real-time task assignment and path generation methods that support manual masking in dynamic open scenes, and propose a task planning model for human-machine integration; 2) Explore multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn skills without a reward function, and create a lightweight behavior planning model that outperforms the teacher model by using the human-machine integration training methods; 3) Study intelligent auxiliary decision-making algorithms that help bridge the switching gap between human and machine, and build an emergency planning model for human-machine integration. The scientific problem stems from the demand for the intelligent development of the carrier aviation support system. This project aims to break through the critical technology bottlenecks such as the second-level generation of collaborative paths, the guidance and positioning of key actions, and the emergency decision-making of human-machine integration, so as to achieve stable and efficient human-machine integration motion planning system,and provide useful exploration for the intelligent development of carrier aviation support system in china.
